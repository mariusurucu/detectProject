Project Title:
Face detection using haarcascade algorithm

Summary:
In this project, I had the task of creating a python script to do face detection in images or video sources using the haarcascade algorithm.

Getting Started:
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


Prerequisites and Installing:
To run my sample you need to install the following ->
-> Python v3.6.4 from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/
Just download the executable and run it if you use windows 7+
->Install OpenCV v3.4.1 from https://opencv.org/opencv-3-4-1.html
Download the executable if you are running Windows 7+
After the installation, you need to make the OpenCV compatible with python v3.6.4.
You will need to pip install some Wheel files to make OpenCV compatible with python v3.X.X,
so watch this tutorial:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izN-NLpS5t8
->Install what python ide you like
